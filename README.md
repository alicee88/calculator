# Calculator
An Odin Project project built to practice HTML/JSS/CS skills.

A calculator app that can add, divide, subtract, and multiply.

Features include:
* Keyboard support
* Floating point numbers
* Rotate option so you can read 0.7734 as HELLO
* Backspace
* Respects BODMAS rules

The real challenges for this project involved the calculation logic. I initially implemented the logic similar to MS Calc which was pretty straightforward. However, updating the code to handle BODMAS was challenging, even with Dijkstra's [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) to reference. It was a good practical example of stacks and queues in a real-world situation.

I improved my knowledge of colour combinations when styling the CSS, using the [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create), and with **regex** when adding keyboard support. I also learned some simple transitions to make the calculator rotate.
