# Calculator
An Odin Project project built to practice HTML/JSS/CS skills.

A simple calculator app that can add, divide, subtract, and multiply.

Options include:
* Keyboard support
* Floating point numbers

The real challenges for this project involved the calculation logic. Whilst the calculations themselves were straightforward, considering when to perform them (i.e. when a user strings together multiple calculations without pressing **=** in between), and how to handle cases that were outside the core workflow (e.g. pressing operators or **=** without valid inputs), took time.

I improved my knowledge of colour combinations when styling the CSS, using the [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create), and gained some valuable experience with **regex** when adding keyboard support.
